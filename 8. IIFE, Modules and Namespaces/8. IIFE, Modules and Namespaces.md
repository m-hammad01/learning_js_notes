## ES Modules
- ### Why ES6
    - Abstraction
    - encapsulation
    - resuablity
    - manage dependencies
- ES6 modules allow you to split your JavaScript code into separate files, called modules, and import/export specific parts of those modules to use in other files. This helps in organizing your codebase and makes it easier to reuse and maintain.
- In case of default export we dont need to specify any name for the imported element. secondly you can only have a single default export per module. also you dont need to use curly braces {} while importing.

## Namespace
- namespace is used to provide scope to the identifiers to prevent collisions between them. it isolates these contets such that same identifers can be used in different namespaces.
