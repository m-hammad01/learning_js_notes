# Classes
    - constructors
    - 
# Factories
    - The Factory Pattern in JavaScript is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It allows for object creation without exposing the instantiation logic to the client, promoting loose coupling and flexibility in object creation.
